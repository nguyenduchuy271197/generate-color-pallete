## What is a color palette?

Color palettes, also known as color scales, are essential for any design project as they consist of a set of tints and shades that define a project's semantic colors. These values are then used to shape the look of UI components, states, illustrations, and overall design style.

### States

State colors are used to display the interactive values of components and text. These colors represent various states such as errors, success, focus states, and so on. You typically have five states available to you.

Chart colors are unique and should be selected with special care, considering their individual characteristics and rules of construction.

## What is the outcome?

- For smaller projects, you might only require four to five colors, including primary, white, black, gray, and some secondary colors

- For larger projects, sets of dozens of colors may be necessary, and that is perfectly acceptable

## Make it transparent

Unfortunately, gray elements and text on a colored background can look unattractive, detracting from the overall design

At the very least, you should have scales of transparent colors for white and black. The number of colors in the scale will vary depending on your project. It's best to use a certain step, such as 10%, and include a few values for very low transparency (3%, 5%, 7%). This will help you cover a wide range of tasks.

## Create tints and shades

Color tints (light) and shades (dark) offer a wide range of design possibilities by introducing variations in elements and their states

## Make a color builder

Fortunately, there is a solution. Construct a color builder. To create a palette, you can make the base color transparent for tints and add transparent on a darker color to get shades. I always use this method when designing palettes.
